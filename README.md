# plotly_deployment
By Gladys Robles

## Overview:
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. For this assignment I am completing the interactive dashboard and adding the three charts named above. 

## Resources:
The research data of 153 individuals including their unique and anonyms ID, demographic information, belly button scrubbing frequency, and belly button biological footprint.

**JavaScript** and **Plotly.js** library. 
JavaScript enables us to create visualizations that are attractive, accessible and interactive. 

For this project I used the following tools:
* The data, stored in a json file named **samples.json**
* The table is built by inserting JavaScript and Plotly into HTML page using the **charts.js** file
* HTML to build the webpage with the **index.html** file
* CSS and Bootstrap to style the page with the **style.css** file
* Chrome Developer Tools to test the code
* GitHub to deploy and showcase the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard using the Pages feature
