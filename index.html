             Operational Taxonomic Unit.<br> 
             <br>
             it is an operational definition used to classify groups of closely related individuals. The term was originally introduced in 1963 by Robert R. Sokal and Peter H. A. Sneath in the context of numerical taxonomy, where an "Operational Taxonomic Unit" is simply the group of organisms currently being studied.

            <p>
              Now, for the most part, the microbes in your navel are harmless. In fact, recent studies suggest that bacteria on your body may strengthen your skin's defense system, but if you never clean your belly button, they'll grow unencumbered, and that can be a problem.

          <p>
            Your belly button is a scar, your very first one. It forms when a doctor snips your umbilical cord, and, depending on how it heals, you could have an outie or, more likely, an innie. And innies are ripe for colonization, not only by lint, hair, and dead skin cells, but also by bacteria.<br><br>In one study, 60 volunteers swabbed their belly buttons. Researchers then analyzed the samples and found more than 2,300 kinds of bacteria. That's an average of 67 different kinds per belly button. Now, many of those microbes aren't unique to belly buttons, like staphylococcus, which can lead to staph infections. It shows up in noses, throats, hair, and, yes, even belly buttons.
